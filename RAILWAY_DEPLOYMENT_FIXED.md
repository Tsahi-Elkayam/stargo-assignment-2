# 🚂 Railway Deployment - FIXED

## ✅ All Issues Have Been Fixed!

### 🔧 Changes Made:

1. **Fixed PORT Configuration** (`exporter/src/main.py`)
   - Updated to use Railway's dynamic PORT environment variable
   - Line 104: `port = int(os.environ.get('PORT', ...))`

2. **Created Railway-Specific Dockerfile** (`Dockerfile.railway`)
   - Simplified deployment configuration
   - Uses production dependencies only
   - Properly structured for Railway's build system

3. **Created Production Requirements** (`exporter/requirements.prod.txt`)
   - Removed development dependencies
   - Only includes: prometheus-client, requests, pyyaml

4. **Updated Railway Configuration** (`railway.json`)
   - Simplified to minimum required settings
   - Points to Dockerfile.railway

5. **Removed Custom PORT Variable**
   - Railway sets its own PORT dynamically
   - No need for PORT=8000 in variables

## 🚀 Deploy Now!

Run this single command:
```bash
python deploy-to-railway.py
```

Or manually:
```bash
# Remove custom PORT (Railway sets its own)
railway variables --remove PORT

# Deploy
railway up

# Get URL
railway domain
```

---

## 📊 After Deployment:

Your app will be available at:
- **Metrics**: `https://your-app.up.railway.app/metrics`
- **Health**: `https://your-app.up.railway.app/health`

---

## 🔍 If Deployment Still Fails:

1. **Check logs**: `railway logs`

2. **Try simple Dockerfile**:
   ```bash
   # Edit railway.json to use Dockerfile.simple
   # Then deploy again
   railway up
   ```

3. **Manual deployment via Dashboard**:
   - Go to https://railway.app/dashboard
   - Click your project
   - Drag and drop the folder

---

## ✨ Everything is ready! Just run:
```bash
railway up
```

The deployment should work now! 🎉
